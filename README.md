# portfolioChallenge

## Description
This is a webpage for my soon-to-be full portfolio
I created this as a test for creating html and css documents, experimenting with postioning and some of the new features we've learned in class, and to display/showcase my work in programming so far.


It was useful to see how well I could do in an actual environment and create something from scratch!

## Table of Contents
This is probably too short of a README to require a Table of Contents...

## Installation
No installation required! N/A

## Usage
Visit the following link :

https://shawncrook411.github.io/portfolioChallenge

Once loaded you can use Google Tools to open up the html and see what's going on behind the scenes!

The actual repo can be found here :
